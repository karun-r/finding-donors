    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "As this s a classification problem, I'd pick Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and Ensemble Methods considering the dataset at my disposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes:\n",
    "* Most common real world use case for Gaussian Naive Bayes is its usage by email providers to mark spam emails and keep them out of the inbox. Being a problem with only two output classes, the simplicity of Naive Bayes will help in preparing a more intuitive model.\n",
    "* Strengths of Naive Bayes: For simple classification with minimal number of categories, Naive Bayes works more efficiently when compared to other complex models. And since the data we have is continous, we will have to go with Gaussian Naive Bayes instead of the regular one. And the numerical nature of the data will play along well with the computations involved in Naive Bayes.\n",
    "* Weakness of the Naive Bayes:  As it entirely depends on the previous occurence to calculate the probability of an event given some data, there is a chance that it might predict zero probability of some new event happening.\n",
    "* As mentioned above, since our data is continous and numeric with relatively less number of samples, Gaussian Naive Bayes is an ideal candidate for this problem. It also works because we have a conditional dependency between most of our features after one hot encoding. Naive Bayes was proved to work well even with features where there is no conditional dependency between them [1]. And as this is a classification problem, Naive Bayes is a good fit for predicting the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines:\n",
    "* Support vector machines are widely used in pattern recogniztion applications like text recogninzition, digit recognizition etc. \n",
    "* SVM has major advantages with this dataset because it is primarily a binary classifier [2]. We don't have to complicate the model by using pairwise calculations as we are making a prediction among only two classes.\n",
    "* SVM might suffer when the output classes are multi-fold. And our choice of kernels and optimization parameters often limit our model performance and they influence the data points that ends up as support vectors.\n",
    "* SVM is a good choice for our dataset as we have only two output classes and also SVM doesn't suffer any local minima in most cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Methods:\n",
    "* My understanding is that ensemble methods are suitable for almost any of the application since we can apply multiple models on the dataset and average it out to get an efficient model [3]. \n",
    "* As mentioned in the point above, we can get much more efficient and accurate model as we employ multiple individual models or multiple instances of the same model to create a classifier. This often irons out any variance that the individual models might be possessing. And depending on the technique we use to combine the results of the individual algorithms, we can also take care of the bias appropriately when we use Ensemble methods.\n",
    "* As we are generating multiple classifiers, this process might take more time when we have huge dataset at our disposal. And also we might need more resources to run all the classifiers. \n",
    "* For CharityML, predicting accurately about who will be able to donate to their cause is very much important so that they can focus their campaigning efforts on to those specific group of individuals. There is very less room for error. So, we can give Ensemble methods a try with the dataset we have at our disposal.\n",

    "As per the results above, there is a close contention between SVC and Bagging Classifier when only F Score is considered. But if we see the time taken for training the model and the time took by model to predict the results, we can see that the we are better off using bagging classifier than the SVC. As we increase the sample size, the actual time taken for the model to train has increased multifold in the case of SVC when compared to the bagging classifier. This further strengthens our argument that SVC is better suited for smaller datasets. For the dataset we have, the bagging algorithm is producing more efficient predictions and is also taking much lesser time among the three. So I believe that we should go with Ensemble model for the CharityML problem."

    "**Answer: **  To explain this ensemble model in layman terms, we can imagine this simply as the combination of two or more individual models and aggregating their results over several iterations to come to a final conclusion. This helps in ironing out the variance introduced by the individual models. For example, let us assume that a certain donor chose to contribute to the cause and donated $10K to the project. Another donor opted to go with non financial support and donated office space for CharityML company to run their offices. Their choice of donation might've been tailored towards the argumnents put forth by the CharityML team who contacted them. If we consider each of the donors as individual Machine Learning algorithms, the variety of donations they provided is equivalent to the \"Variance\" introduced by each model. Often, the variance of a model depends on the input dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task of the ensemble algorithm here is to average out the individual model responses and propose a final class for the given input data. During the financial year closing, the auditors hired by the CharityML company might consider the donations received in all forms and aggregate them to figure out the total donations received. During this process, they might do some calculations to convert all the different modes of donation to a single form. For example, they might put in the ficsal value of the office space donated by a donor. The job of ensemble algorithm is similar to this. It considers the variance introduced and averages it out by working on different samples of the dataset. This aggregation again has different approaches and depending on the dataset, we choose one suitable for our task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "And coming to our specific example, as we are using a bagging classifier which uses one single base estimator, we run the model 100 times. Each time, a random subset will be choosed from the provided input dataset and then, in the end, the ensmeble model will take care of aggregating all the results to predict the class of a data point.
